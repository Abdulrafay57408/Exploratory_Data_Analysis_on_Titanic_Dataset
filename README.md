# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, generate insights, and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling. The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers and their survival status, making it an excellent dataset for exploring feature relationships and predictive modeling.

### Features of this Project:
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin), handling outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Feature Engineering:** 
  - Creating new features, such as **Family Size** (combining siblings/spouses and parents/children), **Title** (extracting titles from names), and **Fare per Person**.
  - Categorizing features like Age and Fare into bins for better analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Generating insightful plots (e.g., survival rates by class, age distribution, and gender survival comparison) to understand data trends.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing the dataset using key statistics like survival rates, correlations, and distributions.
- **Insights Generation:** Highlighting patterns, such as how survival rates varied based on factors like gender, class, and family size.

### Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Python**: For data analysis and processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and feature engineering.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive documentation and execution.

### Purpose:
This project demonstrates the systematic process of exploring and enriching a dataset, emphasizing the importance of feature engineering and data visualization. The Titanic dataset serves as a great example for understanding survival patterns and preparing data for predictive modeling.
